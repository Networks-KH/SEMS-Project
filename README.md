In this project, we are working on improving the methods of
collecting electricity bills by integrating a smart system through which we
can know the amount of electricity consumed, and this is done through some
sensors such as the voltage measurement sensor and the current
measurement sensor, and sending the consumed electricity value to the
Blynk Cloud and also showing the amount of electricity consumed on
the LCD screen.

we calculate the current through the current sensor,
and we also calculate the voltage through the voltage sensor, and we process
these values in the microcontroller and send them to the Blynk Cloud
via Wi-Fi, through which we can know the amount of electricity consumed.

Implementation Steps:

▪ Determine the parts used in the system .

▪ Purchase the parts and make sure they work .

▪ Theoretical study of each piece of how it works and what it is related to.

▪ Connect the parts with the ESP 32 as a unit and choose the port connected to the ESP
32 for the piece .

▪ Download the Arduino coding program .

▪ Work on the code for each piece with the ESP 32 .

▪ Verify the validity of the code by clicking on the verification icon in the Arduino
program.

▪ ESP 32 wire connected to the device .

▪ Ensure that the board used is the ESP 32 and the port is the same port that is
connected to the Arduino.

▪ Raise the code for each piece with the ESP 32.

▪ Follow the results in the serial screen and verify the correctness and operation of the
code .

▪ Connect all parts with ESP 32.

▪ Write the complete system code.

▪ Upload the complete code to the system on ESP 32.

▪ Review the results that appear in the serial screen.

▪ Connect ESP 32to WIFI network .

▪ Connect to server.

▪ Connect to application .
